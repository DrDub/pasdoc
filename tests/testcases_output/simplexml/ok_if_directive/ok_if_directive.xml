<unit name="ok_if_directive.pas">
  <description><abstract>PasDoc fails to parse this, it seems that $if is not understood at all.</abstract><detailed> Bug spotted by Michalis on 2005-12-04 when trying `make htmldocs' on fpc compiler sources, in file globals.pas. Update 2005-12-05: $if is sorta handled now, and so is $ifend. This testcase is parsed now. There is still work remaining to be done with regards to $if and $elseif, this is documented on [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/ToDo].</detailed></description>
